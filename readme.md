# nvim

`nvim` is a personal Neovim setup, it is highly inspired
by [doom-nvim](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/doom-nvim) and covers **only** my needs.

## Measuring startup time

In case you want to measure my configuration startup time, you can use the script called
`measure_nvim.sh` in `extern` directory.
